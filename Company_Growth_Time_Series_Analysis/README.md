### Situation: 

On this project you'll find a time series analysis performed to asses if it is a good idea or not for comapny A to invest in company B based on its performace during the past 850 days. Company A bases its business model in lending money to other companies with an interest of 6% which is returned monthly based on the revenue of the company B. The sooner company B is able to return the money lent, the better for company A, since that means that company A can invest that money on another company, let's call it company C.

### Models trained:

Both ARIMA and Facebook Prophet were trained and their outcomes were compared in order to use the best performing one to make the final forecast, upon which the calculations of the ROI rate are based.

### Metrics:

MSE (Mean Squared Error) was used to compare which of the models was performing best.


### Results:

The company is growing and its revenue follows a positive trend.

Investing €50K is, although the most viable option, still a risk. With €50K the growth rate of company B should be around 117% and the predicted annual growth of the company for the next 12 months is only 89%.
