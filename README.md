# Welcome!

First of all, thank you for taking some time to check me out. I truly appreciate it!

On another note, here you can find different projects that I solved using one or several Machine Learning models. Each project is in a separate Jupyter Notebook. I am still working on uploading them, so they are not all here, but they will be very soon. So, don't forget to come back to check them out.

I hope these projects help you get a grasp of my knowledge and abilities in regard to ML and, in case of doubt, feel free to write me an email to yvonne.muller.martorell@gmail.com.

Hope to hear from you soon!
